Download the folder, run 'nodemon server.js'. This should run the server at localhost: 1337. Users on the same website should 
all be able to add messages to the conversation board.

In this project I built a simple nodejs server. When users access the url they will be asked to provide a name.
They then will be able to send messages to the general message board and all users accessing the board will be able to see
the sent messages.

Nodejs handles the website and the messages are handled with sockets.io
